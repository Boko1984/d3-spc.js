**Note**: This is very much a work in progress.

Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a common charting method used frequently in manufacturing domains (though it is applicable to a much broader scope as well).  To perform SPC analysis, various tools are often used - most of which cost money or require some expertise.  This library attempts to provide a similar and basic approach to SPC charting and analysis that is available for free and is accessible to new comers to the tool.

As progress is made with this library, I'll update this file with instructions on use of the library.  Until then, stay tuned.
